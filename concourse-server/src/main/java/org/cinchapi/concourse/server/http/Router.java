     *         return data;
     *     }
     * 
     * });
     * </pre>
     * 
     * The router will fill in variables defined in the specified template with
     * the appropriate values from {@code data()}.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * <h3>Defining Endpoints</h2> An {@link Endpoint} returns a json payload in
     * response to an HTTP request. Endpoints are defined as follows:
     * 
     * <pre>
     * </pre>
     * </p>
