       You can use Java or Groovy syntax (e.g. no paranthesis) to invoke meth-
       ods  in CaSH. Groovy syntax is only parseable in standalone statements.

       aadddd(key, value) -> _l_o_n_g
              Add _k_e_y (String) as _v_a_l_u_e  (Object)  within  a  new  record  and
              return its id.

       aadddd(key, value, record) -> _l_o_n_g
              Add  _k_e_y  (String)  as _v_a_l_u_e (Object) within _r_e_c_o_r_d (long) if it
              does not currently exist and return  a  boolean  that  indicates
              success or failure.

       aadddd(key, value, [records]) -> _M_a_p_[_L_o_n_g_, _B_o_o_l_e_a_n_]
              Add  _k_e_y  (String)  as  _v_a_l_u_e  (Object)  in  each of the _r_e_c_o_r_d_s
              (List[Long]) in the list. Return a  mapping  from  each  of  the
